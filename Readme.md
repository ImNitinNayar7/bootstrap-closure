Bootstrap JS + Closure Compiler
-------------------------------

This was a prototype largely written during Winter Vacation 2014.

Goals: 

 + Statically Type Bootstrap's JavaScript Source
 + Introduce Global Util Method
 + Refactor JS to be more "closure-y"

---

Gulp Tasks

 + `$ Gulp` - runs jshint, jscs, unit tests, and copmiles source
 + `$ Gulp Dist` just runs closure dist
 + `$ Gulp Test` just runs tests

All visual tests running + unit tests running against compiled and uncompiled code.
